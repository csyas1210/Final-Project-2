<h1>Historical Facts</h1>
<hr>

<p>In  California, homlessness last year was almost 130,000, nearly a quarter of the national total. Homelessness is also a more visible part of life in California. A vast majority of its homeless people are unsheltered, living under. However, if you look at the rate of homelessness in the United States, taking into account the population of the state or region, Washington, D.C., ranks first, followed by New York, Hawaii and California. It is accepted that the starting point of vagrancy is followed back during provincial America. As ahead of schedule as 1640, the English "transients" were recorded as outsider people and the police were after them. The vagrants were viewed as "Strong poor people" in the mid eighteenth century and they were found in each edge of the pioneer towns. The issue of vagrancy at that period was an aftereffect of the Lord Philip' War Of 1675-1676 against the local individuals. Numerous states were driven out of their homes to look for cover in the timberlands or beach front territories. During the American Unrest, the vagrancy expanded more than ever. Numerous people not long after the war were constrained into vagrancy because of lacking needs.
